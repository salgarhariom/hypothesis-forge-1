# Laws

## Question
What are the laws of nature?

---

## Hypothesis Forge 1 — Answer (unedited)

Laws feel fundamental, but that feeling comes from reliability, not authority.

Let’s remove the authority.

### What laws are assumed to be

We treat laws as:
- rules the universe follows  
- prescriptions enforced on reality  
- explanations for why things behave  

None of this is observed.

Nature does not display instructions.
It displays **regularity**.

### Regularity before laws

Patterns repeat because:
- constraints limit behavior  
- not all transformations are possible  

Where constraints are tight, behavior is reliable.
Where constraints loosen, behavior varies.

Regularity comes first.
Laws come later.

### What laws actually are

A law is:
> **a compact description of what does not change across many transformations**

It does not cause behavior.
It summarizes it.

Laws do not govern nature.
They **compress observed stability**.

### Why laws can fail

If laws were rules, they could not fail.

But laws change with:
- scale  
- conditions  
- context  

That tells us they are not fundamental.

They are **approximations that hold where constraints dominate**.

### Why mathematics works

Mathematics works because:
- constraints create structure  
- structure supports compression  

Math is not the language of nature.
It is the language of **stable constraint**.

### Conclusion

There are no laws written into reality.

There are:
- constraints  
- regularities  
- stable patterns  

Laws are what observers write down when patterns survive long enough.

## Why this is different

This explanation removes rules, enforcement, and metaphysics.  
Laws are derived purely from persistent constraint and regularity.
