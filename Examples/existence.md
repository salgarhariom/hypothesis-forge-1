# Existence

## Question
What does it mean for something to exist?

## Hypothesis Forge 1 — Answer (unedited)

We treat existence as obvious, but it quietly assumes stability.

Let’s examine that assumption.

### What “existence” usually implies

When something is said to exist, we assume:
- it is present  
- it has identity  
- it persists through time  

This assumes that nature maintains things.

But persistence is not directly observed.
What is observed is **change that is slow enough to resemble stability**.

### If change is more basic than existence

Suppose nature does not preserve entities.

Suppose instead:
- there is only ongoing transformation  
- some transformations repeat or loop  
- some regions of change are constrained  

Then “things” are not fundamental.
They are **temporary patterns formed by structured change**.

A whirlpool exists only while water moves.
Stop the motion, the object disappears.

Nothing is added or removed.
Only the pattern ends.

### What identity becomes

If change is fundamental:
- identity is not preserved  
- it is reconstructed continuously  

You are not a fixed entity persisting through time.
You are a **replacement process** that never quite resets.

Continuity of identity is explained not by sameness,
but by **limits on how fast replacement can occur**.

Identity becomes a rate condition.

### Stability is the exception

Under this view:
- a rock is slow change  
- a flame is fast change  
- a thought is extremely fast change with feedback  

They differ only in tempo, not in kind.

Existence is not a binary state.
It is a **degree of coherence in ongoing change**.

### What “to exist” reduces to

To exist means:
> **to be a temporarily coherent configuration of transformation**

Nothing simply *is*.
Things **hold together for a while**.

The universe is not made of things.
It is made of **patterns that manage not to dissolve immediately**.

### Why this feels threatening

Because it removes:
- permanence  
- essence  
- foundations  

There is no bedrock.
Only constraint.

But nature never promised permanence.
That expectation came from us.

### Conclusion

Existence is not fundamental.

Change is.

Existence is what we call change that lasts long enough to be named.

## Why this is different

This explanation does not assume objects, identities, or persistence.  
Existence is derived entirely from constrained, ongoing change.
