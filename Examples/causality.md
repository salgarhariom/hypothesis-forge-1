# Causality

## Question
What is causality, really? Do causes actually produce effects?

---

## Hypothesis Forge 1 — Answer (unedited)

Causality feels obvious, but that feeling hides several assumptions.

Let’s remove them.

### The hidden structure behind “cause”

When we say “A causes B,” we assume:
- A is a stable thing  
- B is a stable thing  
- A exists first, B exists later  
- Something transfers influence from A to B  

None of these are directly observed.

What *is* observed is **continuous transformation**.

### If nothing is stable, causality changes meaning

Suppose there are no fixed entities — only ongoing change.

Then:
- there are no permanent causes  
- there are no permanent effects  
- there is no clean boundary between “before” and “after”  

There are only **patterns of change feeding into other patterns of change**.

What we label as a cause is just:
> **a region of transformation that flows into another without interruption**

No arrow is required.
No metaphysical push is required.

### Why causality appears directional

Causality feels one-way because:
- transformations are irreversible  
- later structures retain traces of earlier structures  
- memory accumulates but does not un-accumulate  

The direction does not come from causality itself.
It comes from **asymmetry in change**.

Causality inherits direction from irreversibility.

### Why prediction works anyway

Even without “causes,” prediction still works because:
- patterns of change are constrained  
- constraints limit how transformations can continue  

If a configuration appears reliably before another, we treat the earlier one as a cause.

This is not because it *produces* the later one,
but because **the space of possible continuations is narrow**.

Causality is a compression strategy for regularity.

### What causality reduces to

Stripped of assumptions:
- causality is not a force  
- it is not a rule  
- it is not a fundamental feature  

> **Causality is a name for consistent sequencing in constrained change.**

We use it because it works, not because nature enforces it.

### Conclusion

Nothing causes anything in the deep sense.

Change continues.
Some continuations are stable enough to predict.
We label those regular continuations as causation.

Causality is not what makes the universe run.
It is how observers summarize what does not break.

## Why this is different

This explanation removes causes, effects, forces, and arrows entirely.  
Causality is rebuilt only from continuity, constraint, and irreversible change.
