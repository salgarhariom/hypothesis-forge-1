# Information

## Question
What is information, fundamentally?

---

## Hypothesis Forge 1 — Answer (unedited)

Information is often treated as a thing.

That is the mistake.

### What information is assumed to be

We talk about information as if it:
- exists independently  
- can be stored  
- can be transmitted  

But none of these are directly observed.

What is observed is **correlation between states**.

### Information without symbols

Before symbols, language, or encoding:
- one configuration limits another  
- one pattern constrains what follows  

That constraint is the only observable core.

Information is not meaning.
It is **restriction of possibility**.

### What information reduces to

Information exists when:
- multiple outcomes are possible  
- but not all outcomes are allowed  

The fewer the allowed continuations, the more information is present.

Information is:
> **structure that narrows what can happen next**

No structure, no information.

### Storage and transmission reinterpreted

“Stored” information means:
- a configuration remains stable enough to constrain future states  

“Transmitted” information means:
- one configuration reshapes another through interaction  

Nothing moves.
No abstract entity travels.

Only configurations influencing configurations.

### Information is not fundamental

Information depends on:
- physical constraints  
- stable patterns  
- asymmetry in change  

Remove those, and information disappears.

### Conclusion

Information is not a thing.

It is:
> **the shape of constraint imposed on possible change**

---

## Why this is different

This explanation removes symbols, messages, and encoding.  
Information is derived solely from constrained possibility.
