# Observer

## Question
What is an observer, fundamentally?

---

## Hypothesis Forge 1 — Answer (unedited)

An observer is often treated as something special.

It is not.

### What an observer is assumed to be

We usually assume an observer:
- watches reality from the outside  
- records what happens  
- is separate from what is observed  

None of this is fundamental.

### Observation as interaction

Observation is not passive.

To observe is:
- to interact  
- to disturb  
- to constrain  

An observer is not outside reality.
It is **part of the interaction pattern**.

### What an observer actually is

An observer is:
> **a system whose internal structure is altered in a way that constrains its future behavior**

That is all.

No awareness required.
No intention required.

A thermometer is an observer.
A rock struck by another rock is an observer.

### Why observers seem special

Observers feel special because:
- they retain memory  
- they build internal models  
- they react based on past interactions  

But these are degrees, not categories.

There is no sharp boundary where observation begins.

### Observation without truth

Observation does not reveal reality “as it is.”

It produces:
- correlations  
- constraints  
- internal structure  

Truth is not extracted.
Structure is formed.

### Conclusion

An observer is not a witness.

An observer is:
> **a pattern of change that has been reshaped by interaction**

---

## Why this is different

This explanation removes consciousness and subject-object dualism.  
Observation is rebuilt purely from interaction and structural change.
