# Reality

## Question
What is reality, if nothing has fixed identity?

---

## Hypothesis Forge 1 — Answer (unedited)

Reality is usually treated as a collection of things.

That framing already fails.

### What reality is assumed to be

We often assume reality:
- contains objects  
- has a fixed structure  
- exists independently as a stable backdrop  

None of this is directly observed.

What is observed is **ongoing interaction and transformation**.

### Reality without objects

If there are no fundamental things, then:
- reality is not made of entities  
- it is not a container  
- it is not a static structure  

Reality is **what continues to happen**.

Remove all interaction and nothing remains to describe.

### Reality as constraint, not substance

Reality is not defined by what exists,
but by **what cannot happen**.

Constraints determine:
- which transformations are possible  
- which patterns persist  
- which configurations dissolve  

Reality is the total constraint landscape of change.

### Why reality feels solid

Reality feels solid because:
- many constraints are strong  
- many patterns reconstruct reliably  
- instability is often hidden  

Solidity is a statistical outcome, not a foundation.

### No observer-independent snapshot

There is no final, complete state of reality.

At any moment:
- structure is incomplete  
- patterns are mid-reconstruction  
- constraints are actively shaping outcomes  

Reality is not a finished object.
It is **ongoing resolution**.

### Conclusion

Reality is not a thing that exists.

Reality is:
> **the totality of constrained change that does not collapse**

## Why this is different

This explanation removes substances, objects, and static worlds.  
Reality is derived entirely from interaction and constraint.
