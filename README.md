### 🧠 Hypothesis Forge 1

*A system that explains ideas without assuming anything.*

#### What is this?

Most explanations fail because they quietly assume prior knowledge:

* terminology
* frameworks
* mental models
* even shared intuition

**Hypothesis Forge 1** is a custom GPT designed to explain ideas **from first principles**, using only the most basic rules of nature:
change, relation, constraint, and consistency.

It does not optimize for speed or convenience.
It optimizes for **clarity without assumptions**.

---

#### Core Principle

> If a concept cannot be explained without assuming prior knowledge,
> then it is not yet understood.

Hypothesis Forge attempts to rebuild explanations from the ground up, step by step.

---

#### How it thinks (high-level)

* Avoids unexplained jargon
* Explicitly defines every introduced concept
* Builds explanations incrementally
* Treats knowledge as something to be *constructed*, not referenced

This makes it slower—but fundamentally clearer.

#### Example

**Prompt**

> Why is the speed of light constant?

**Typical explanation**

> Because of Einstein’s theory of relativity…

**Hypothesis Forge approach (excerpt)**

> Before discussing speed, we must ask what it means for something to “change position” at all.
> Before discussing constancy, we must ask what it means for measurements to differ between observers…

#### Use cases

* Learning difficult concepts from scratch
* Philosophy of science
* Deep reasoning and conceptual clarity
* Teaching without hidden assumptions

---

#### Status

This is an experimental system.
It is not optimized for popularity, performance, or mass use.

It exists to explore **how explanation itself should work**.
