## Hypothesis Forge1

This project begins from a simple refusal:

**We refuse to explain anything by assuming what has not been shown.**

Most explanations fail quietly.
Not because they are wrong,
but because they import hidden structure:
objects, laws, identities, time, causes, meanings —
as if nature agreed to our categories.

It has not.

---

### What we observe

We do not observe:
- permanent things  
- intrinsic identities  
- flowing time  
- governing laws  
- stored information  

We observe:
- change  
- constraint  
- asymmetry  
- interaction  
- patterns that sometimes persist  

Everything else is inference.

---

### Our starting point

**Change is not something that happens to reality.  
Change is what reality is.**

Stability is not fundamental.
It is a special case where change reconstructs itself reliably.

Existence is not given.
It appears where coherence lasts.

---

### What this implies

If change is primary, then:

- Time is not a container  
  It is the ordering of irreversible transformation.

- Identity is not preserved  
  It is reconstructed within tolerance.

- Causality is not a force  
  It is reliable continuation under constraint.

- Information is not a thing  
  It is restricted possibility.

- Memory is not storage  
  It is persistent structural consequence.

- Laws are not rules  
  They are compressions of regularity.

- Observers are not outside reality  
  They are interaction-shaped systems.

- Meaning is not intrinsic  
  It is constrained response.

Nothing mystical is added.
Nothing metaphysical is required.

### What this project is

Hypothesis Forge is an attempt to **rebuild explanation from the ground up**.

It does not optimize for:
- speed  
- familiarity  
- authority  

It optimizes for:
- minimal assumptions  
- internal consistency  
- conceptual honesty  

When language fails, we stop.
When a concept cannot be derived, we discard it.

---

### What this project is not

This is not:
- a new ontology  
- a theory of everything  
- a replacement for science  

It is a discipline:
**do not smuggle conclusions into premises.**

---

### Why do this at all?

Because understanding should not depend on:
- prior training  
- hidden metaphors  
- institutional consensus  

If something is real,
it should survive being stripped down.

---

### The rule

> **If an explanation requires assuming the thing it claims to explain,  
> it has not yet begun.**

This project exists to begin again.
